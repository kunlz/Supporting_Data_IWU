# Satellite-based Global Irrigation Water Use date set (2011-2018)

This dataset is based on satellite soil moisture, precipitation, vegetation index, meteorological data radiation, and air temperature, through the principle of soil water balance, coupled with remote sensing evapotranspiration process module and using data-model fusion algorithm based on differential optimization to estimate the actual irrigation water use of the global irrigated area. This data set is compared with the survey data of China's Ministry of water resources, the U.S. Department of agriculture, and the United Nations Food and agriculture organization. The results show that good comparison results have been achieved in different spatial scales, such as the comparison of agricultural water use statistical results of China's provinces in 2015 (bias ~= -3.10 KM3), and the comparison of survey data of U.S. states in 2013 (bias ~= -0.42 KM3) The comparison results of each FAO country scale (bias ~= -10.84 KM3). The data set will help to quantitatively evaluate the spatial and temporal pattern of agricultural irrigation water in historical period and support scientific agricultural water management.  

Filename rule: grid-based irrigation water use is stored in NetCDF format, and the file name is "IWU_ ens_ Yyyyy ", where yyyy stands for the year. Like IWU_ ens_ Y2011.nc represents this NetCDF file to describe the grid-based data of global irrigation water use with a monthly scale in 2011.
